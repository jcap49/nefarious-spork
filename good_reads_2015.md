#### Good Reads - 2015

The below is a short list of books with a few reactions that I remember reading this year; my goal is to be a bit better about tracking these in 2016.

[Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End](http://www.amazon.com/Being-Mortal-Medicine-What-Matters/dp/0805095152/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451355541&sr=8-1&keywords=being+mortal) - Atul Guwande  
This is the only book I've read all year, during which I've shed tears on multiple occassions. Having watched someone close to me grapple with many of the issues Guwande discussed, I found myself frustrated not to have read the book a year ago when it was first published. I'm grateful to have a more nuanced understanding of aging and mortality; this book definitely makes it into my 'adult toolkit'.  

[Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America](http://www.amazon.com/Devil-White-City-Madness-Changed/dp/0375725601/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451355607&sr=8-1&keywords=devil+in+the+white+city) - Erik Larson   
Larson's got this knack for writing such rich and engaging historical non-fiction prose -- Devil in the White City was no different. The architectural/engineering challenges in planning the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition were suepr fascinating & of course, the serial killer narrative was riveting.

[The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics](http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Boat-Americans-Berlin-Olympics/dp/0143125478/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451355702&sr=1-1&keywords=boys+in+the+boat) - Daniel James Brown  
Great, quick read that simultaneously painted pre-WWII Germany in a new light for me, while also giving me an appreciation for a new sport.

[Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life](http://www.amazon.com/Barbarian-Days-Surfing-William-Finnegan/dp/1594203474/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451355770&sr=1-1&keywords=barbarian+days+of+surfing) - William Finnegan  
Hilarious, almost whimsical narrative about a New Yorker writer's trials & tribulations of growing up a vagabond surfer in the 60s & 70s. Laughed when I read the passage about Finnegan's time in Ocean Beach in SF -- [@bjp](http://twitter.com/bjp) & I splashed about in the frigid waves, and called it surfing after an hour.

[In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin](http://www.amazon.com/Garden-Beasts-Terror-American-Hitlers/dp/030740885X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451355817&sr=1-1&keywords=in+the+garden+of+beasts) - Erik Larson  
Another Larson book (h/t [@brendan_o](http://twitter.com/brendan_o)) that was super interesting to read alongside the above Boys in the Boat. Great parallel perspectives (each with different angles) about pre-WWII Berlin; this one had a much more diplomatic hue to it.

[House of God](http://www.amazon.com/House-God-Samuel-Shem/dp/0425238091/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451355886&sr=1-1&keywords=house+of+god) - Samuel Shem   
h/t [@elliotcohen](http://twitter.com/elliotcohen) brutally cynical & painfully honest take on the field of medicine with so much dark humor. 

[Empire of Sin: A Story of Sex, Jazz, Murder, and the Battle for Modern New Orleans](http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Sin-Murder-Battle-Orleans/dp/0770437087/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451355901&sr=1-1&keywords=empire+of+sin) - Gary Krist  
Epic look at New Orleans -- this city is now on the list of places I'd like to travel to for 2016. 

[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream](http://www.amazon.com/Fear-Loathing-Las-Vegas-American/dp/0679785892/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451356025&sr=8-1&keywords=fear+and+loathing+in+las+vegas) - Hunter S Thompson  
Just read this.

[A Place in Time: Twenty Stories of the Port William Membership](http://www.amazon.com/Place-Time-Stories-William-Membership/dp/1619021889/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451356017&sr=8-1&keywords=a+place+in+time+wendell+berry) - Wendell Berry  
Really enjoyed Berry's ability to tell sweepingly beautiful narratives within a single setting.

[The Pale King](http://www.amazon.com/Pale-King-David-Foster-Wallace/dp/0316074225) - David Foster Wallace   
Worth it.

[Shantaram](http://www.amazon.com/Shantaram-Novel-Gregory-David-Roberts/dp/0312330537/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451355995&sr=1-1&keywords=shantaram) - Gregory David Roberts  
'Larger than life, holy hsit could this have really happened' sort of story.

[We Are Not Ourselves](http://www.amazon.com/We-Are-Not-Ourselves-Novel/dp/1476756678/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451356010&sr=1-1&keywords=we+are+not+ourselves) - Matthew Thomas  
Good, simple story with relatively engaging characters. A feel good sort of story.
